## Motor Control Project

Helicopter control design has to be implemented in a way that must account for six degrees of freedom.  Each degree of freedom represents a different direction in which a helicopter may travel, and increased degrees of freedom lead to more complex designs.  Our project is aimed at designing a helicopter control system in which a helicopter is constrained to moving radially, and vertically.  Using only two degrees of freedom greatly simplifies the problem of control and the problem becomes as simple as controlling the speed, and hence the lift force generated by each motor. By controlling two different motors, one commercial, and one self-built motor,  we can control the radial, and vertical position of our motor to demonstrate a takeoff and landing sequence.
